With Time Blocks, users can create and manage time blocks for working, relaxing and studying. My task is creating UI and adding night mode to the application.

## Light and Dark Mode
### **Change Mode**

The Toggle Button on the left hand side will enable Dark Mode of the application. 
Click that button! Now you can relax your eyes ...
If you wish to return to the regular theme, simply click it again.
