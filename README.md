# **Time Blocks**
A team project at uni where we developed a web app to create and manage time blocks for working, relaxing and studying. My task is creating UI and adding night mode to the application.

##### Thi Khanh Uyen Tran 


## Light and Dark Mode
### <img src="Images/Toggle-button.gif" height="100px" width="180px"/> **Change Mode**

The Toggle Button on the left hand side will enable Dark Mode of the application. 
Click that button! Now you can relax your eyes ...
If you wish to return to the regular theme, simply click it again.
